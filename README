2.Classroom scene

a classroom environment with the help of simple cubes, cuboids and quads.


3.Bezier curve and surface modelling

make a Bezier curve and using that Bezier curve, we would like to create a surface of revolution.
Sampled the curve made at uniform interval of size 0.1. Made a surface of revolution using these sampled points on the curve. Saved it in a file as OFF format.
